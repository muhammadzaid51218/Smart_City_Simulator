Smart City Simulator

A Python-based simulation of a smart city designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project models various city components—buildings, citizens, vehicles, traffic lights, and more—and their interactions to mimic real-world urban dynamics.

Features

Core classes for Buildings, Citizens, Vehicles (with inheritance for Car, Bus, EV), Traffic Lights, and the City itself.

Operator overloading for intuitive interactions (e.g., combining vehicle trips).

Simulation of daily activities like commuting, energy consumption, and traffic management.

Exception handling for real-life challenges such as fuel shortages and traffic jams.

File handling to save and load city states in JSON format.

Extensible design supporting public transport scheduling, emergencies, economy, and sustainability modules.
